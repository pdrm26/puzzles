Pig Latin is a common children’s “secret” language in English- speaking countries.
(It’s normally secret among children who forget that their parents were once children themselves.)
The rules for translating words from English into Pig Latin are quite simple:

    - If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), add “way” to the end of the word. So “air” becomes “airway” and “eat” becomes “eatway.”

    - If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on the end of the word, and then add “ay.”
    Thus, “python” becomes “ythonpay” and “computer” becomes “omputercay.”
