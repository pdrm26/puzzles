Write a function hex_output that converts a hexadecimal number (entered as a string) to its decimal equivalent,
without using int() to convert the entire number at once.
For example, if the user enters "50", the function should output 80 (since 0x50 = 80 in decimal).

Key points:

Input is a hex string (e.g., "50", not "0x50")
Convert digit by digit (can use int() for single digits)
Cannot use direct hex-to-decimal conversion of the full number
