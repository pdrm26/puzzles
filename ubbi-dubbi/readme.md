# Ubbi Dubbi Translator Challenge

## Description

Ubbi Dubbi is a fun, secret children's language where every **vowel** (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefixed with **"ub"**. For example:

- `milk` becomes `mubilk` (m-ub-ilk)
- `program` becomes `prubogrubam` (prub-ogrub-am)

The rules are simple:
1. Insert **"ub"** before every vowel in the word.
2. Consonants remain unchanged.
3. If two vowels are next to each other, each vowel gets its own **"ub"** prefix. For example:
   - `soap` becomes `suboubap`.
